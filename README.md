# yahoo-imap

Download yahoo email and save with attachments.
You will be able to select folders to download, or INBOX.
You can also control the size of the batches to download, or ALL.


## How to use
in order to access yahoo mail, you will need to set up a one-time application password.  this is not your regular user password!
this can be done by logging into yahoo and going [here](https://login.yahoo.com/account/security).

when this code is invoked you will be required to enter your yahoo email address and app password:

```
    # Get credentials
    print("Yahoo Email Retriever")
    print("Note: You'll need to use an App Password, not your regular Yahoo password")
    print("Generate one at: https://login.yahoo.com/account/security")
    print()

    username = input("Enter your Yahoo email address: ")
    password = getpass.getpass("Enter your App Password: ")
```


```
